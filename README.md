# Homework-Assignment-12-Object-Oriented-Programming

What is object oriented programming (OOP)?
   - The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model real world things
   that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple
   way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible
   to make use of. We'll then have to create instances of the objects
   which will be used in our javascript code.
   
Why would you use object oriented programming (OOP)?
   - They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which
   you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors
   provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an
   effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.
   
Use of OOP in a project:
   - For example: If you want to purchase a desktop computer. You need to
   consider several products (Apple, Acer, HP). Thus, the customer can
   order any of the desktop computer depending on the available efficiency
   and prices of each product. Let's take a look at the project below:
   
   class Computer {
    display,
    processor,
    memory,
    storage,
    graphics,
    price,
    purchaseDevice()
}

class AppleModel offers Computer {
  purchaseDevice [
    "Speed",
    "Security",
    "Accessories"
  ]
}

class AcerModel offers Computer {
    "Speed",
    "Security",
    "Accessories"
}

class HPModel offers Computer {
    "Speed",
    "Security",
    "Accessories"
}

class efficientDevice {
  gaming,
  officeWork [],
  addComputer (display, processor, memory, storage, graphics, price, account)
  addOrder(orderAccount)
}
